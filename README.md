# Recipe Box #

One of my earliest Django website. Over the course of 2 months new features were added to the site.

Basic functionallity of the Recipe Box:
* User may create and login as a registered user/author.
* User may create/add/edit recipes of their own which link to their user's page.
* User my see other user pages and their recipes.
* User may favorite recipes, including their own, which will appear on their user page.
* If the user is an admin, they may create/edit authors as well as other user's recipes. Also they may create a recipe under another author's info.

See screenshots of the proof of concept. All screen shots are from working Django code using Python, HTML, and CSS.
